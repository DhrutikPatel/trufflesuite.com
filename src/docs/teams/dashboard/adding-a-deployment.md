# Adding a deployment

To get started with the dashboard, first you will need to select a repository and [deploy your DApp](/docs/teams/deployments/deploying-contracts). Once you have a deployment available, you can select that deployment to monitor via the dashboard by clicking <span class="inline-button">ADD DEPLOYMENT</span>.

<p class="alert alert-info">
  These instructions assume you have already created a Teams account. For documentation on how to get your Teams account up and running, see
  <a
    href="/docs/teams/getting-started/creating-an-account" target="_blank">here</a>
  and <a href="/docs/teams/getting-started/adding-repositories" target="_blank"> here.</a>
</p>

Once you have added a deployment to monitor, you will be taken to the main dashboard page where you can see at-a-glance information about your deployment.
