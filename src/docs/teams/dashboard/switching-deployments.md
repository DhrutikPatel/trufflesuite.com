# Switching deployments

As your DApp matures and changes, you may find you want to change the deployment you are monitoring with the dashboard. To do this, simply click the <span class="inline-button">SWITCH DEPLOYMENT</span> button at the upper right of the dashboard screen. Once you have opened the deploymemt choice modal, pick the deployment you wish to monitor.

<p class="alert alert-info">
  If you are working on a DApp with a team of developers, changing the dashboard deployment
  will make the change for all developers on your team.
